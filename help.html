      <h3>Assignment 1 Peer Marking</h3>

      <p>The peer marking page allows you to rate the work of the other students
      in COMP249 for Assignment 1. The final ratings given will be used as 
      part of the final score for the assignment.</p>
 
      <p>Before you start you must enter your Student ID and your name
      you must have submitted the assignment to rate someone elses work
      so your student ID is checked against the list of submitted 
      work.  Of course, if you know someone elses student ID you could
      vote for them, but that wouldn't be nice. If someone
      has voted for you, let me know and I'll clear the votes.</p>
      
      <p>You can only connect once to this application with a given Student ID.
      So, please don't provide your ID if you don't have time to rate at least
      10 stylesheets (10 minutes?). You will only be allowed to rate 20
      stylesheets at most.</p>

      <p>You are asked to rate the stylesheet on two dimensions:</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Visual Appearance</strong> - is the overall effect of the
	stylesheet attractive and does it make the play easy and pleasurable 
	to read?</li>
	
	<li><strong>Use of Technology</strong> - does the stylesheet make
	good use of CSS features rather than just changing the font and colour
	of various elements. (Wow, how did they do that == Good)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>You are also asked to provide some feedback to the student. Use 
      this to make a comment if you want to say more than the scales
      allow.  Try to imagine what you'd like to hear about your own 
      work.  Please don't insult anyone; I reserve the right to filter
      the comments if needed.</p>
      
      <p>Please give some time to considering your rating. 
      
      <p><strong>Cheating</strong> If it is obvious that this process
      has been abused then I won't use the results in marking the
      assignment. Abuse could be the use of an automated script to vote
      for stylesheets, attempts to vote for your own script, etc.
      Please respect this process and rate the work of your peers fairly.</p>
